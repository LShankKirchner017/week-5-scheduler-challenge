This project was to use starter code provided by the program to create functionality in a scheduling website using 3rd party APIs such as day.js and jQuery. 


Portions of this code were work through with the help of tutoring with Brooke Love on July 6th and office hours on July 6th. 


This website allows the user to see their schedule, the current time, and allows them to store events in their calendar.
